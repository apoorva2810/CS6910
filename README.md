# CS6910

## Assignment 1
Dataset : fashion mnsit  
<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;Write your own backpropagation code and keep track of your experiments using wandb.ai

<br/><br/> <br/><br/> 
## Assignment 2
Dataset : inaturalist 
<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;Learn how to use CNNs: train from scratch, finetune a pretrained model, use a pre-trained model as it is

<br/><br/> <br/><br/> 
## Assignment 3
Dataset :  Dakshina dataset released by Google
<br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;The goal of this assignment is fourfold: (i) learn how to model sequence to sequence learning problems using Recurrent Neural Networks (ii) compare different cells such as vanilla RNN, LSTM and GRU (iii) understand how attention networks overcome the limitations of vanilla seq2seq models (iv) visualise the interactions between different components in a RNN based model.
